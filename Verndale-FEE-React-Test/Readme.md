# Technical evaluation for Verndale
I'm expert in vuejs that is another MVVM framework inspired in React and Angular, but no that expert in react but this test was interesting to learn more about react and to see that there several similarities with Vuejs. 

### Configuration added
I added the "npm start" command, the auto launch server feature when you start and configured babel to support "async / await" syntax.
Added some packages "isomorphic-fetch es6-promise" to support "fetch" data from server in IE 11

### Next features to add
Add a "Loader" because sometimes the request would take some time.
Add a debounce to avoid several requests when pressing keys.

### Instructions:

first install the npm packages running:
```npm install```
then:
```npm start```

and that's it!
